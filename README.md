# LaunchBase - Challenge 2 - CSS and Modal use
  This project is part of a bootcamp made by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) - LaunchBase.  
  The main challenge was to use in some pages the concepts showed during the classes - mainly CSS, Material Icons and simple scripts to create a set of Cards and a Modal content.
